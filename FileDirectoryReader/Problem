Write a shell script that declares and defines variables to store the name of a java class and the name of a directory consisting of a number of text files. The java program in the shell script will print the following information about the files in that directory.


1) The total number of files
2) The content of each file and the total number of words in each file.
3) Word frequency (i.e, number of occurrences of each word in the file )
4) Content of each file after removing the stopwords

Note that you cannot use any libraries, even not for stopword removal. You must use your own list of stopwords and use them for the removal task.
